    <h2> About Me: </h2>
    <p> Hey there! It's-a me, Mario! </p>
    <p>I'm a Italian plumber in Brooklyn who somehow ended up in the Mushroom Kingdom, and honestly, I'm not sure how the rent works here.</p>
    <p>My resume is a bit unconventional—I've saved princesses, raced go-karts, played every sport imaginable, and even practiced medicine without a license (don't tell the medical board).</p>
    <p>When I'm not jumping on turtles or collecting coins that mysteriously float in mid-air, you can find me eating mushrooms that make me grow to twice my size. My brother Luigi keeps telling me they're "probably not FDA approved," but what does he know? He's afraid of ghosts.</p>
    <p> hobbies include:</p>

    <p>Destroying bricks with my head (surprisingly good for stress relief)</p>
    <p>Exploring pipes that definitely violate several plumbing codes</p>
    <p>Maintaining a complicated relationship with a fire-breathing turtle</p>
    <p>Saying "wahoo!" at extremely inappropriate times</p>

    <p>Fun fact: I've died more times than I can count, but I keep coming back. Persistence is key, folks! </p>

    <h3> ⭐ Power-Up Connoisseur: </h3>
    <p>Mastered the use of over 50 different power-ups including Fire Flowers, Super Stars, Tanuki Suits, and whatever that bee costume was about. Side effects may include temporary invincibility and an inexplicable urge to fly </p>

    <h3> 🍄 Mushroom Kingdom Citizen of the Year: </h3>
    <p>Awarded honorary citizenship after saving the kingdom from Bowser for the 47th time. Benefits include unlimited mushroom consumption and a restraining order against Goombas.</p>

    <p>8-time Mario Kart Grand Prix winner. Known for strategic banana peel placement and throwing turtle shells at family members. Luigi is still not speaking to me from last Thanksgiving. </p>

    <h3> 👨‍⚕️ Dr. Mario, MD (Mushroom Destroyer): </h3>
    <p>Eliminated millions of viruses using a pioneering "match three capsules" technique. Medical degree legitimacy questionable, but results speak for themselves.</p>

    <h3> 🌟 Star Collector Extraordinaire: </h3>
    <p>Gathered over 999 Power Stars across multiple galaxies. NASA has expressed interest in my space travel methods, but I don't think "launch from a cannon" is what they're looking for.</p>
